# WhisperTag-spec
Wisper is the code name for a project whose goal is to develop a product designed to help pet owners keep track of their pets. The primary target is dog or cat owners.

# Problem 
Pet owners want to let their pets be as free as possible, but since pets can't speak to us and we can't be watching over our pets constantly, it is hard to strike the right balance between safety and liberty with our pets.

Many pet owners do not want to resort to more severe approachs to geo-fencing including existing digital pet fence technologies that apply negative reinforcement to maintain compliance with geo-fence boundaries. 

These owners would prefer to be aware of the pets location in real-time and over time on-demand and notified only if the pet leaves a specific boundary.

# Solution

A small physical geo-tag device that can be attached to a pet's collar combined with a mobile device that offers innovative pet location monitoring capabilities. 

Unlike Apple AirTags, the Whisper will provide fine-grained granular location data that will easily allow you to monitor your pet's location in higher precision and better reliability than Apple devices that quickly lose capabilities beyond a few feet of range. 

WhisperTag is designed to triangulate your pet's position using three independent signals
* home wi-fi
* mobile wi-fi hotspot
* mobile bluetooth

By combining three independent signals to triangulate location, Whisper can offer greater resolution and reliability over a larger range.
